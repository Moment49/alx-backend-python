# 🌀 Advanced Python Generators Project

## 📘 About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving **live data streaming** and **memory-efficient computations**.

The tasks are designed to deepen your understanding of Python’s `yield` keyword, allowing you to build systems that **access data iteratively**, reduce memory usage, and improve performance — especially in data-intensive applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, the following concepts and skills were mastered:

### 🧠 Master Python Generators
- Implemented custom generator functions using `yield`.
- Understood generator behavior through real use cases.
- Differentiated between normal functions and generator functions.

### 🗃️ Handle Large Datasets
- Applied **lazy loading** to fetch large volumes of data one item at a time.
- Built generators to process **user data in batches**, avoiding memory overload.

### 🌍 Simulate Real-world Scenarios
- Created generator pipelines to mimic **live updates** and **data streams**.
- Simulated fetching paginated user records using offset-based logic.

### 🚀 Optimize Performance
- Used generators to compute **aggregate functions** like average age.
- Ensured all computations were done without loading full datasets into memory.

### 🧾 Apply SQL Knowledge
- Integrated SQL queries within generator logic to pull records dynamically.
- Used pagination techniques with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in SQL to stream data incrementally.
